\section{Overview}
The goal of the course project is to apply the Numerical Optimization and Estimation algorithms learned during the class on a practical robotic system. Various implementations of these 
robotic systems will be provided to you. This is an individual project and each student submit their own individual work. Every student should present a 
report not exceeding [FILL] pages and present their results in a 5 minute presentation to the class. The report is due[FILL] and presentation will be [FILL]
%In addition, you are free to use your own robotic system implementation. Interested students can also use C++ implementations of these systems. 
%
%Students using their own system implementation should verify with the professor before proceeding. 

\section{Suggested Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Robotic manipulator
\item Car model
\item Quadcopter model
\item Mobile manipulator (a manipulator mounted on a mobile robot) among obstacles
\item Attitude planning and control of a satellite subject to sun-camera angle
avoidance constraints, with: 1) two momentum wheels, 2) three momentum wheels subject to uncertain disturbances
\item Planning and control of a unmanned surface vehicle (USV) among obstacles, subject to 1) underactuation: e.g. modeled as a motor-boat with two
propellers, or 2) full actuation and subject to external uncertain disturbances.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deliverables}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proposal: a 1/2-page description of the chosen problem and example scenario
  that will be implemented and tested.
\item Proposal Summary Presentation: 3 minute presentation of your project proposal
\item Progress Report: a report (3 page max) of your current progress
\item Progress Presentation: 5 minute presentation summarizing your progress
\item Final Paper: a paper (6 pages max) documenting your analytical work,
  algorithm implementation, and experiments
\item Final Presentation: 15 minute presentation of project results
\end{enumerate}

\section{Schedule}
You should select a project topic (and pair in teams if applicable) by 03/31.
In order to review and finalize your topic please meet with Prof. Kobilarov preferably 
during office hours on 3/31. You will present your initial project proposal in class 
on Wednesday 4/2, give a progress report presentation on 4/23, and a final presentation on 
5/10 (the date reserved for final examination). 
Project reports are due in beginning of class as specified in the schedule below. 
Note that we will have a take-home final that will be due the day of the final exam; 
your poject presentations will be held during the regular final exam time.
